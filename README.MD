## Steps to Complete the Assignment

1. Open Pycharm Pro / Pycharm Community and clone the assignment repository. Open up a terminal in Pycharm, run "pip
   install -r requirements.txt" and then run "pytest".  **If pycharm shows you an error about pip / requirements when
   you clone the repo just skip/cancel/dismiss the error and run the command in the terminal like I said above**
2. You will need to complete the requirements for the assignment and remove/replace the tests that are meant to fail
   that I placed in each file.
3. When your pytest passes just commit and push it back to the origin and the assignment will be graded automatically by
   GitHub running the test that you run locally.
4. Check that your tests pass on GitHub after you push the assignment and then submit a link to your repository to the
   assignment in Canvas. In GitHub on the repository, click the actions tab on GitHub to see your tests run. You will
   need to click on the autograding workflow to inspect that screen to see the detail test results.
